# Image segmentation length detection algorithm (ISLDA) and growth kinetics fitting
 <br /> This repository contains several matlab scripts that does the following:
 <br /> (a) Extracts crystal size distributions (CSD) of crystal ensembles over time  (Compilation2, ISLDA2, concatenate, detectlocal2Dmaximabetter, Histogramming, ignorenoisepeaks, keeplargestcomponent and Miniphotoshop)
 <br /> (b) Extracts the size dependent growth rates of crystals, based off the Abegg Stevens and Larson (ASL) model (growthkineticsCSD and growthkineticsfitting)
 <br /> 
 <br /> Image segmentation length detection (ISLDA):
 <br /> Compilation2 is the main file which compiles results from ISLDA2
 <br /> ISDLA2 is an image segmentation length detection algorithm that segments overlapping aggregates of crystals from single crystals
 <br /> 
 <br /> Growth kinetics fitting:
 <br /> growthkineticsCSD is the main file which compiles results from growthkineticsfitting function file. The user is able to see the histograms of actual and simulated CSD
 <br /> growthkineticsfitting fits the ASL model growth function
 
 <br /> The scripts are run using MATLAB.
 <br /> Codes written by Ariel Y. H. Chua,  G. Y. Tan in collaboration with Dr Eunice W. Q. Yeap , Dr David M. Walker , Dr Joel M. Hawkins , Dr Saif A. Khan
